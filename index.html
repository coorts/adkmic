      <h1 style="color: #131313">Andrew David Keithley<span>.</span></h1>
      <p>Even after Andy’s passing, people say they can still feel his
        calm presence surrounding them and offering peace. He had this special affect on everyone he came in contact with. Andy 
        was the person who would always make time for you, even when his schedule was busy. Andy was the oldest son of David and Christy Keithley.  He was helpful, loving, willing, funny and an incredible example to those around him.  He was raised in a Christian home by loving parents.  Even when his parent’s 
        relationship ended in divorce, Andy continued to stay strong throughout the tumultuous times. Through these trials, Andy’s faith became the corner stone in his life.</p>
      <p> Andy had a special needs brother, Charlie, who was two years younger than him.  He had a close and unique relationship with 
        him.  Andy helped out above and beyond what was expected and never complained. He even wanted to learn sign language 
        in high school to understand his brother better.  Andy had a fun relationship with Luke and Delaney, his other siblings. He 
        was a role model and example for them, but also knew how to add humor along the way. He loved to play tricks on them, 
        always making life lively and fun within the home. </p>
      <p>Andy was an incredible student, athlete, and friend throughout his years in school. He always helped the kids who felt out of place or needed an extra hand. He swam, played football, basketball, and volleyball. In addition, he was a dedicated member of the Christian organization, Young Life, at Lafayette 
        High School. His presence is missed greatly because of the rock he was to other students. He did not let go of his values in high 
        school like so many kids. Andy instead “walked the walk” as the saying goes. He was the one that others looked up to and 
        were inspired by. Andy had changed jobs from The Galaxy Theater to work at Lion’s Choice so that he would have time in his schedule for sports, Young Life and still have time to socialize with friends and spend time with family. Andy was an excellent student as well and his grades always reflected this. 
        He had an ability to honor and achieve his goals in all areas of his life.</p>
      <p> Andy had a mantra during his life called “make it count”. Before any sports game, his dad would yell onto the field, 
        court, or over the pool those words.  On the last week of his life, Andy called those same words to his dad, as he got ready to get 
        on a plane at Lambert airport.  All of Andy’s achievements, as well as his humble, loving nature are proof that he lived up to 
        that mantra and truly made his life count.</p>
